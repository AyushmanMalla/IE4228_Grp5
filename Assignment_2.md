- Design and implement a deep learning-based human face detection and recognition system that can accurately detect and recognize faces in real-time using a live camera. You will explore and utilize deep learning methods, e.g., FaceNet and MTCNN, while being encouraged to research and experiment with other state-of-the-art deep learning models and techniques.

- Collect face images of all team members and a few additional individuals to build a database for live face detection and accurate recognition. Ensure that each person in the database has more than 10 face images.
- For the live demo, faces should be highlighted with bounding boxes and correctly identified if they are present in the database. If the face is not in the database, an "unknown" signal should be displayed.
- You may directly utilize off-the-shelf face detection models, such as MTCNN, and face recognition models, like FaceNet. However, if you wish to go further, you may opt to fine-tune these models using the face images you have collected for improved performance.
- Additionally, you may explore publicly available face detection and recognition datasets, such as VGGFace, to train your own face detection and recognition network.
- If you choose to implement other face detection and recognition algorithms based on deep neural network architectures, ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the chosen methods. Provide a detailed explanation in your report and during the group presentation or demonstration.
- The assessment will be conducted by oral presentation, demonstration and interview in week 12 & 13 in the Lab. A live demonstration GUI is required. During the demonstration, all team members should pose in front of the camera for detection and recognition.
- Half of teams of each lab class will do the demo of assignment 1 in week 12 and assignment 2 in week 13 while the other half of teams will do the demo of assignment 2 in week 12 and assignment 1 in week 13.
- A detailed technical report per team, which describes your project and performance analysis, source code and a list of individual contributions of each member and signed by each member, must be submitted in one PDF or WORD file per team to NTULearn before the week of your lab assessment.
- Each student submits 3-5 minutes video for each Assignment for individual assessment by the end of week 13.
